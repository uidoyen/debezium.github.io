Quickly following up to last week's release of Debezium 0.9, it's my pleasure today to announce the release of Debezium *0.9.1.Final*!

This release fixes a couple of bugs which were reported after the 0.9 release.
Most importantly, there are two fixes to the new link:/docs/connectors/sqlserver/[Debezium connector for SQL Server],
which deal with correct handling of LSNs after connector restarts (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1128[DBZ-1128], https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1131[DBZ-1131]).
The connector also uses more reasonable defaults for the `selectMethod` and `fetchSize` options of the SQL Server JDBC driver (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1065[DBZ-1065]),
which can help to significantly increase through-put and reduce memory consumption of the connector.

The MySQL connector supports `GENERATED` columns now with the new Antlr-based DDL parser (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1123[DBZ-1123]),
and for the Postgres connector the handling of primary key column definition changes was improved (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-997[DBZ-997]).

In terms of new features, there is a new container image provided on Docker Hub now:
the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/tooling[debezium/tooling] image contains a couple of open-source CLI tools
(currently https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[kafkacat], https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie[httpie], https://github.com/stedolan/jq[jq], https://github.com/dbcli/mycli[mycli] and https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli[pqcli])
which greatly help when working with Debezium connectors, Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect on the command line
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1125[DBZ-1125]).
A big thank you to the respective authors these fantastic tools!
