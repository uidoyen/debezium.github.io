I am excited to announce the release of Debezium *1.4.0.Alpha1*!

This first pass of the 1.4 release line provides a few useful new features:

* New Vitess connector
* Allow fine-grained selection of snapshotted tables

Overall, the community fixed https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%201.4.0.Alpha1%20ORDER%20BY%20issuetype%20DESC[41 issues] for this release.
Let's take a closer look at some of the highlights.
+++<!-- more -->+++

== Vitess Connector

https://www.vitess.io[Vitess] is a database solution for deploying, scaling, and managing large clusters of MySQL.
We are very happy that the development team around Ruslan Gibaiev and Kewei Shang of https://bolt.eu/en/[Bolt Technology OÃœ] decided to build a CDC solution based on Debezium and to https://www.github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-vitess[open-source it] under the Debezium umbrella.
This connector is released in *incubating* state in Debezium 1.4.

Ruslan and Kewei will follow up with a blog post with more details around this connector very soon;
in the mean time please refer to the connector https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.4/connectors/vitess.html[reference documentation] to learn more.

== Fine-grained Selection of Snapshotted Tables

One of the major focus points for Debezium 1.4 is to explore more flexible snapshot options,
e.g. to re-snapshot chosen tables or parallelizing long-running snapshot operations.

A first improvement related to snapshotting is the new connector configuration `snapshot.include.collection.list`,
which allows to snapshot only a subset of all the tables which the connector will capture later on during log reading.
This comes in handy if for instance you're interested in capturing changes to all your tables, but only need an initial snasphot of the data for some of them.

For the Postgres connector, by creating a custom implementation of the `Snapshotter` SPI contract, this also allows for a selective re-snapshot of specific tables.
After restarting the connector, such `Snapshotter` would continue to read the log from the point where it left off previously until "now",
then it would take a snapshot of the given tables, and finally continue to read the log for _all_ captured tables.

For more information on this option, please see the connector-specific https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/connectors/index.html[documentation] for more details.
