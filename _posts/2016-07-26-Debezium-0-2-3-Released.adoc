I'm happy to announce that **Debezium 0.2.3 is now available** for use with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1. This release corrects the MySQL connector behavior when working with `TINYINT` and `SMALLINT` columns or with `TIME`, `DATE`, and `TIMESTAMP` columns. See our link:/docs/releases/#release-0-2-3[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with label `0.2` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Chris, Christian, Laogang, and Tony for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
Stay tuned for our next release, which will be 0.3 and will have a new MongoDB connector and will support Kafka Connect 0.10.0.0.
