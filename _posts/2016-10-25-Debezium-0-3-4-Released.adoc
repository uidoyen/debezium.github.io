We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.4** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains several new features for the MySQL connector: support for MySQL's link:/docs/connectors/mysql/#data-types[`JSON`] datatype, a new snapshot mode called link:/docs/connectors/mysql/#snapshots[`schema_only`], and link:/docs/monitoring[JMX metrics]. Also, the Debezium Docker images for Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect have all been updated to allow optionally link:/docs/monitoring[expose JMX metrics] in these services. And, one backward-incompatible fix was made to the change event's `ts_sec` field. See the link:/docs/releases/[release notes] for specifics.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Akshath, Chris, Vitalii, Dennis, Prannoy, and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
