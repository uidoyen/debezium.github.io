I am happy to announce the release of Debezium *1.2.1.Final*!

This release includes several bug fixes to different Debezium connectors, and we highly recommend the upgrade from 1.2.0.Final and earlier versions:

* The Debezium Postgres connector may have missed events from concurrent transactions when transitioning from snapshotting to streaming events from the WAL (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2288[DBZ-2288]);
this is fixed now when using the link:/documentation/reference/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-property-snapshot-mode[exported snapshotting mode];
this mode should preferably be used, and for Debezium 1.3 we're planning for this to be the basis for all the existing snapshotting modes
* The Postgres JDBC driver got upgraded to 42.2.14 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2317[DBZ-2317]),
which fixes a CVE in the driver related to processing XML column values sourced from untrusted XML input
* The Debezium MySQL connector MariaDB's supports `ALTER TABLE` statements with `IF EXISTS` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2219[DBZ-2219]);
it also handles single dimension `DECIMAL` columns in `CAST` expressions (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2305[DBZ-2305])
* The MySQL connector automatically filters out specific DML binlog entries from internal tables when using it with Amazon RDS (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2275[DBZ-2275])
* The Debezium MongoDB connector got more resilient against connection losses (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2141[DBZ-2141])

If you're using the https://www.apicur.io/registry/[Apicurio] open-source API and schema registry for link:/documentation/reference/configuration/avro.html[managing the JSON and Avro schemas] of your Debezium connectors,
then things got a bit simpler for you:
the Debezium container image for Kafka Connect comes with the required converters out of the box now
(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2083[DBZ-2083]).

Overall, 34 issues were fixed for this release; please refer to the link:/releases/1.2/release-notes/#release-1.2.1-final[release notes] for the full list of addressed issues, upgrade procedures, and notes on any backward compatibility changes.
