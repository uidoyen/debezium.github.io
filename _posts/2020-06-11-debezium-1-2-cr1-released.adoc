It's my pleasure to announce the release of Debezium *1.2.0.CR1*!

This release includes several notable features, enhancements, and fixes:

* PostgreSQL can restrict the set of tables with a publication while using pgoutput (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1813[DBZ-1813]).
* Metrics MBean registration is skipped if a platform MBean server does not exist (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2089[DBZ-2089]).
* SQL Server reconnection improved during shutdown and connection resets (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2106[DBZ-2106]).
* EventRouter SMT can now pass non-String based keys (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2152[DBZ-2152]).
* PostgreSQL `include.unknown.datatypes` can now return strings rather than hashes (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1266[DBZ-1266]).
* Debezium Server now supports Google Cloud PubSub (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2092[DBZ-2092]).
* Debezium Server now supports Apache Pulsar sink (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2112[DBZ-2112]).
