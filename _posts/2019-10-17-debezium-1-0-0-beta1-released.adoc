History is in the making as Debezium begins to sprint to its 1.0 milestone.
It's my pleasure to announce the release of Debezium *1.0.0.Beta1*!

This new Debezium release includes several notable new features, enhancements, and fixes:

* ExtractNewDocumentState and EventRouter SMTs propagate heartbeat &amp; schema change messages (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1513[DBZ-1513])
* Provides alternative mapping for `INTERVAL` columns via `interval.handling.mode` (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1498[DBZ-1498])
* Ensure message keys have the right column order (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1507[DBZ-1507])
* Warn of table locking problems in connector logs (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1280[DBZ-1280])

Additionally, several PostgreSQL issues were fixed to improve snapshotting large databases environments (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-685[DBZ-685]) and specific circumstances where write ahead logs (WAL) would continue to consume diskspace (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-892[DBZ-892]).

In total, this release contains link:/releases/1.0/release-notes/#release-1.0.0-beta1[18 fixes].
