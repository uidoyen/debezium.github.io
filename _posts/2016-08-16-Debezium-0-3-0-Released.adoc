After a few weeks delay, **Debezium 0.3.0 is now available** for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains an updated link:/docs/connectors/mysql/[MySQL connector] with quite a few bug fixes, and a new *_link:/docs/connectors/mongodb/[MongoDB connector]_* that captures the changes made to a MongoDB replica set or MongoDB sharded cluster. See the link:/docs/connectors/[documentation] for details about how to configure these connectors and how they work.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with labels `0.3` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Andrew, Bhupinder, Chris, David, Horia, Konstantin, Tony, and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
