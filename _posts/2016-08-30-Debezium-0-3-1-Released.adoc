We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.1** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains an updated link:/docs/connectors/mysql/[MySQL connector] with a handful of bug fixes and two significant but backward-compatible changes. First, the MySQL connector now supports using secure connections to MySQL, adding to the existing ability to connect securely to Kafka. Second, the MySQL connector is able to capture MySQL string values using the proper character sets so that any values stored in the database can be captured correctly in events. See our link:/docs/releases/#release-0-3-1[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to Chris, Akshath, barten, and and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
