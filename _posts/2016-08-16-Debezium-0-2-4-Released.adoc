I'm happy to announce that **Debezium 0.2.4 is now available** for use with Kafka Connect 0.9.0.1. This release adds more verbose logging during MySQL snapshots, enables taking snapshots of very large MySQL databases, and correct a potential exception during graceful shutdown. See our link:/docs/releases/#release-0-2-4[release notes] for details of these changes and for upgrading recommendations.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] (with label `0.2` and `latest`) used in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial].

Thanks to David and wangshao for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
Stay tuned for our next release, which will be 0.3 and will have a new MongoDB connector and will support Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1.
