We're happy to announce that **Debezium 0.3.3** is now available for use with Kafka Connect 0.10.0.1. This release contains a handful of bug fixes and minor improvements for the link:/docs/connectors/mysql/[MySQL connector], including better handling of `BIT(n)` values, `ENUM` and `SET` values, and GTID sets, This release also improves the log messages output by the MySQL connectors to better represent the ongoing activity when consuming the changes from the source database. See the link:/docs/releases/[release notes] for specifics.

We've also updated the https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/[Debezium Docker images] labelled `0.3` and `latest`, which we use in our link:/docs/tutorial/[tutorial]. We've also updated the tutorial to use the https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[latest Docker installations] on Linux, Windows, and OS X.

Thanks to Akshath, Chris, Randy, Prannoy, Umang, Horia, and others for their help with the release, issues, discussions, contributions, and questions!
