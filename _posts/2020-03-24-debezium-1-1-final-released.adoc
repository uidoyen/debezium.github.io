It's with great excitement that I'm announcing the release of Debezium *1.1.0.Final*!

About three months after the 1.0 release, this new version comes with many exciting new features such as:

* a link:/documentation/reference/1.1/integrations/outbox.html[Quarkus] extension facilitating the outbox pattern
* support for the link:/documentation/reference/1.1/integrations/cloudevents.html[CloudEvents] specification
* an incubating link:/documentation/reference/1.1/connectors/db2.html[connector for the IBM Db2 database]
* transaction marker events
* support for link:/documentation/reference/1.1/integrations/testcontainers.html[CDC integration testing] via Testcontainers
* a brand-new API Debezium module containing a reworked link:/documentation/reference/1.1/development/engine.html[embedded engine API] as well as an SPI for link:/documentation/reference/1.1/development/converters.html[customizing schema and values of change events]

+++<!-- more -->+++

Besides these key features, there's many other smaller improvements such as reconnects for the Postgres connector, more flexibility when extracting the `after` state from change events,
and more powerful options for propagating metadata on the source types of captured columns.

Since the CR1 release, https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/versions/12344981[22 more issues] were resolved: mostly bug fixes, documentation improvements and related to the stabilization of some flaky tests that'd fail intermittently on our CI server.

Besides these, there's one very useful improvement for the Postgres connector:
as part of its heartbeat functionality, it can now regularly execute DML operations in the source database (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-1815[DBZ-1815]).
This helps to prevent situations with a combination of multiple databases on the same database host,
receiving writes with different frequencies,
where Debezium couldn't acknowledge processed WAL offsets with the source database otherwise.

Overall, https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(1.1.0.Alpha1%2C%201.1.0.Beta1%2C%201.1.0.Beta2%2C%201.1.0.CR1%2C%201.1.0.Final)[123 issues] have been resolved for Debezium 1.1 and its preview releases.

A big, big "thank you" to each and every one of you!

Having shipped Debezium 1.1, the team is focusing on 1.2 now.
Adhering to a quarterly release cadence,
Debezium 1.2 is scheduled for end of June.
You can expect preview releases roughly every three weeks.

What's coming up in 1.2?
Check out the link:/roadmap/[roadmap] to learn more;
one key feature will be a "standalone mode" for running Debezium independently of Kafka Connect,
allowing to feed change events to other messaging infrastructure such as Amazon Kinesis.
Also make sure to let us know about your suggestions, requirements and feature requests!
