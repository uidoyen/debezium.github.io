questions that are relevant to our user community.

== Upcoming Events

Due to the corona virus situation, many conferences the Debezium team had planned to attend, have been postponed or even cancelled.
E.g. JavaDay Istanbul has been moved to September, and QCon Sao Paulo to December.
We hope the situation will have improved by then and look forward to meeting again with the Debezium community in person eventually.

Until then, there's a few virtual events you can enjoy;
there'll be a Debezium session at the https://www.redhat.com/en/summit[Red Hat Summit 2020 - Virtual Experience].
We're also planning to do another episode on Debezium at https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/[DevNation Live].
If you'd like to have a session on Debezium at your virtual meetup or conference, please get in touch!

== Examples

An example is an excellent way to get a better understanding of how or why something behaves as it does.
Debezium's https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples[examples repository] has undergone several changes recently we'd like to highlight:

* [NEW] https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/camel-component[Integration of Debezium with Apache Camel]
* [NEW] https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/camel-kafka-connect[Integration of Apache Kafka Connect and Apache Camel]
* [NEW] https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/cloudevents[Demonstrates how Debezium can publish CloudEvents]
* [NEW] https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/testcontainers[Integration of Testcontainers to perform integration tests for CDC]
* [UPDATED] https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/outbox[Debezium Outbox using the new Debezium Quarkus Outbox extension]

We also discovered a https://github.com/pmsipilot/docker-compose-viz[very helpful tool] for visualizing the contents of Docker Compose files.
So we've begun to add diagrams like this one for the https://github.com/debezium/debezium-examples/tree/master/kstreams-live-update[kstreams-live-update] demo to the examples,
helping to familiarize with the examples more easily:

== Time to Upgrade

Debezium version link:/blog/2020/03/24/debezium-1-1-0-final-released/[1.1.0.Final] was released last week.
If you are using an older version, we urge you to check out the latest major release.
For details on the bug fixes, enhancements, and improvements that spanned 5 releases, check out the link:/releases/1.1/release-notes/[release-notes].

The Debezium team has also begun active development on the next major version, 1.2.
The major focus in 1.2 is implementing a standalone container to run Debezium without Apache Kafka and Connect, enabling users to send change events to Kinesis and other platforms more easily.

Keep an eye on our link:/releases/[releases page] to get a jump start on what bug fixes, enhancements, and changes will be coming in 1.2 as they become available.
